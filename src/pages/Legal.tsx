        <p>What are cookies and why are cookies used:</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Cookies are small text files that contain a unique string of
          characters. They are stored in your web browser's memory when you
          visit a website. When you return to a website that has placed a cookie
          in your browser, it allows the website to recognize your previous
          visit.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          While cookies are commonly used for measuring website usage, such as
          the number of visitors and duration of visit, and for enhancing ease
          of navigation, they can also personalize the experience for known
          visitors by associating cookies with profile information or user
          preferences. This information provides valuable insights to improve
          the user experience over time.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>How we use Cookies:</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          We use cookies and related technologies ("Cookies") to provide
          Services, gather information during user navigation, enhance and
          personalize the user experience, understand usage patterns, and
          improve our Sites, products, and Services.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>The Cookies used on our Sites fall into the following categories:</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Strictly Necessary Cookies: These cookies are essential for the
          website to function properly. They are usually set in response to your
          actions, such as privacy preferences, logging in, or filling in forms.
          Blocking or disabling these cookies may impact the functionality of
          certain parts of the site. These cookies do not store any personally
          identifiable information. Functional and Performance Cookies: These
          cookies enhance website functionality and personalization. They help
          us count visits and traffic sources, measure and improve site
          performance, and analyze popular and unpopular pages. The information
          collected by these cookies is aggregated and anonymous. Some of these
          cookies may be set by us or by third-party providers whose services we
          have added to our pages, such as Google Analytics. Blocking or
          disabling these cookies may affect the performance monitoring of our
          website. Marketing and Advertising (Targeting) Cookies: These cookies
          may be set by our advertising partners. They create a profile of your
          interests and display relevant advertisements on other websites. These
          cookies do not directly store personal information but rely on browser
          and internet device identification. If you block or disable these
          cookies, you may experience less targeted advertising.
        </p>
        <br />

        <br />
        <p>
          Pixel tags, also known as clear gifs, web beacons, or single-pixel
          gifs, are small electronic files embedded in web pages or emails. They
          enable us to track page visits, email opens, and other related website
          statistics, such as content popularity and system integrity. Pixel
          tags serve a similar purpose as cookies but are embedded directly in
          web pages or emails. We may utilize pixel tags in our email marketing
          activities to track email open rates and assess the effectiveness of
          our campaigns.

          note that blocking all cookies may restrict access to our Sites and
          impact the intended functionality. To make full use of our features
          and Services, we recommend enabling at least first-party cookies.
          Device- and browser-specific opt-outs, such as the Google Analytics
          Opt-out Browser Add-on, are available to exercise choice regarding
          specific Cookies.
